# CLASS EXERCISE 1 BY LARA FILIPPONE AND CRISTINA POZZOLI

Our project aims at analyzing how attitudes towards climate change vary depending on age.

Our repository contains the following folders:

"data", which contains the original dataset we used;

"data_recode", which contains the recoded dataset;

"docs", which contains the final project;

"figs", which contains plots;

"junk", which is for the stuff we don't need anymore;

"src", which contains the scripts we used, including the final one.
